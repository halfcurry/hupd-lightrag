Various implementations provide methodologies for automatically formulating machine learning (“ML”) and optimization queries. The automatic generation of ML and/or optimization queries can be configured to use examples to facilitate formulation of ML and optimization queries. One example method includes accepting input data specifying variables and data values associated with the variables. Within the input data any unspecified data records are identified, and a relationship between the variables specified in the input data and a variable associated with the at least one unspecified data record is automatically determined. The relationship can be automatically determined based on training data contained within the input data. Once a relationship is established a ML problem can be automatically generated."

In particular, new local solutions may be evaluated based on local performance criteria when the new solutions are in a global solution deemed to have satisfied a global performance criteria. New local solutions that satisfy their corresponding local performance criteria remain in the new global solution. New local solutions that do not satisfy their corresponding local performance criteria are replaced with a corresponding current local solution from a current global solution, thereby modifying the new global solution. The resulting modified global solution includes both new local solutions and current local solutions prior to being accepted as the current global solution for the next iteration."

When an issue is identified at a component, the system uses a relational schema to determine a set of components on which the component depends and creates a diagnosis model for performing root cause analysis. The diagnosis model includes the component type ACs corresponding to each of the components identified in the relational schema. The system populates the diagnosis model with conditional probabilities and observed state values determined from event indications generated by the components.

Once trained, the machine learning classifier can select a mode of operation for the computing device based upon a user's current brain activity and, potentially, other biological data. The computing device can then be operated in accordance with the selected modality. An application programming interface can also expose an interface through which an operating system and application programs executing on the computing device can obtain data identifying the modality selected by the machine learning classifier. Through the use of this data, the operating system and application programs can modify their mode of operation to be most suitable for the user's current mental state."

Training content (e.g., news articles, books) and a set of entities (e.g., Bill Clinton and Barack Obama) that are related to a concept (e.g., Presidents) is received. Groups of words that co-occur frequently in the textual content in conjunction with the entities are identified as templates. Templates may also be identified by analyzing parts-of-speech patterns of the templates. Entities that co-occur frequently in the textual content in conjunction with the templates are identified as additional related entities (e.g., Ronald Reagan and Richard Nixon). To eliminate erroneous results, the identified entities may be presented to a user who removes any false positives. The entities are then stored in association with the concept."

The imperfect annotations designate a plurality of instances as belonging to the target rare class and others to the majority class. First, a classifier is trained on the set of features using the imperfect annotation as supervision, to designate each instance to either the rare class or majority class. A combination of the predictions from the trained classifier and the imperfect annotations is then used to classify each instance to either the rare class or majority class. In particular, an instance is classified to the rare class only when both the trained classifier and the imperfect annotation classify the instance to the rare class. Finally, for each instance assigned as a rare class instance by the combination stage, all instances in its neighborhood are re-classified as either rare class or majority class."

The disturbance rejection model having a network for mapping system inputs to the system output, and input-output pairings, each representing a unique pairing of one of the system inputs with the system output. The method may include the steps of: calculating a confidence metric for a selected input-output pairing of the disturbance rejection model; and recommending a modification be made to the disturbance rejection model based upon the confidence metric calculated for the selected one of the input-output pairing. The confidence metric may indicate a probability that a predicted sign of a gain in the system output made by the disturbance rejection model is correct when the system input of the selected input-output pairing is varied."

A development sample set is split into two subsets, one of which is used as a training set the other of which is set aside. We define a classifier (e.g., K-nearest neighbor, decision tree, margin-based classifier or other) using the training subset and at least one of the features (or subsets of two or more features in combination). We apply the classifier to a subset of samples. A filter is applied to the performance of the classifier on the sample subset and the at least one feature is added to a “filtered feature list” if the classifier performance passes the filter. We do this for many different realizations of the separation of the development sample set into two subsets, and, for each realization, different features or sets of features in combination.

The system analyzes the first digital image and defines regions of non-intact glands. Intact gland regions are then determined, and regions of stroma are identified. The system defines influence zones between non-intact regions and stroma regions. Using information from the second image, macrophages in the tissue corresponding to the influence zones are identified and counted.

The invention is used to identify a specific decision tree or group of preferred size trees that are consistent across train and test samples in node-specific details that are often important to decision makers. Specifically, for a tree to be identified as preferred by this system, the train and test samples must both agree on key measures for every terminal node of the tree. In addition to this node-by-node criterion, an additional tree selection method may be imposed. Accordingly, the train and test samples rank order the nodes on a relevant measure in the same way. Both consistency criteria may be applied in a fuzzy manner in which agreement must be close but need not be exact."

Various embodiments of the invention provide for high-throughput batching that increases throughput of streaming data in high-traffic applications, such as real-time speech transcription. In embodiments, throughput is increased by dynamically assembling into batches and processing together user requests that randomly arrive at unknown timing such that not all the data is present at once at the time of batching. Some embodiments allow for performing steaming classification using pre-processing. The gains in performance allow for more efficient use of a compute engine and drastically reduce the cost of deploying large neural networks at scale, while meeting strict application requirements and adding relatively little computational latency so as to maintain a satisfactory application experience."

The partitionings and regions are organized via a binary tree and they are allowed to vary in a data-driven way, i.e., in a way to minimize the classification error rate. Moreover, to test a given data point, a mixture of decisions is obtained through the models learned in the regions that this point falls in. Hence, naturally, in the cold start phase of the data stream, the simpler models belonging to the larger regions are favored and as more data get available, the invention automatically puts more weights on the more complex models."

Features of historical inputs from a user as well as corresponding outputs presented to the user in response to the historical inputs are obtained, where the features are previously determined based on contexts of the historical inputs which indicate information related to the user. The features of the historical inputs are assigned into a plurality of groups. An association is determined on the basis of the plurality of groups of features. Specifically, an association indicating inter-group correlations of features from different ones of the groups is determined according to the obtained outputs. Therefore, in determining the association, intra-group correlations such as correlations of features within a group are excluded. In this way, the time and computation complexity for the association determination will be effectively reduced."

The method includes the steps of (1) specimen gross examination, submission and dictation, (2) final diagnosis dictation, and (3) Cancer Protocol Templates construction. SMILE “listens” to the voice commands, “reads” case/slide information, goes through algorithms, and engages in report preparation. SMILE performs secretarial tasks, such as typing, error checking, important information announcing, and inputting commands by simulating keystrokes and mouse clicks, thus enabling the user to focus on the professional tasks at hand. This results in an increase in the efficiency for the user, and a decrease in reporting errors. Human-SMILE interaction is very much human-to-human like, mediated by voice recognition technology and text-to-speech. There is a significant reduction in the keyboard and mouse usage in comparison to e..."

The historical scenarios provide data on racing settings, racing results, and racing conditions such as squad information, equipment information, and environmental information. A cognitive (deep question answering) system can select an initial pattern template based on current racing conditions, and present suggested vehicle settings to the user (driver) using the initial pattern template. The driver can select from different candidate values for various factors, which may lead to the presentation of additional suggestions or the use of additional pattern templates. The final settings map is created based on the employed pattern templates and the driver selections."

In one embodiment, each scheduler may be modeled with a Q-network that maps a high-level representation of the state of the simulation to a control fragment for execution. In such a case, the deep Q-learning algorithm applied to learn the Q-network schedulers may be adapted to use a reward function that prefers the original controller sequence and an exploration strategy that gives more chance to in-sequence control fragments than to out-of-sequence control fragments.

A computerized oracle-selection system identifies candidate “oracle” experts in a field of endeavor known as a domain. The system retrieves contemporaneous natural-language “artifact” documents that each refer to or were produced by an oracle, and contains information from which may be predicted a future event related to the domain. The system assigns each oracle a confidence factor that identifies the accuracy of that oracle's predictions, and ranks the artifacts by how closely each matches the domain and by the confidence factors of its associated oracles. The artifacts are merged into the corpus, where the rankings indicate which artifacts may most reliably be used by the cognitive system to formulate predictive responses to user queries.

Also, the subnetworks convolve 3D data at multiple scales by subjecting the 3D data to parallel processing by different 3D convolutional layer paths. Such multi-scale operations are computationally cheaper than the traditional CNNs that perform serial convolutions. In addition, performance of the subnetworks is further improved through 3D batch normalization (BN) that normalizes the 3D input fed to the subnetworks, which in turn increases learning rates of the 3D DCNNA. After several layers of 3D convolution and 3D sub-sampling with 3D across a series of subnetwork modules, a feature map with reduced vertical dimensionality is generated from the 3D radiological volume and fed into one or more f..."

Using training data, a GMCM estimate can be produced and iteratively refined to maximize a penalized log likelihood estimate until sequential iterations are within a threshold value of one another. The GMCM estimate can then be used to classify further samples. The LASSO constraints help keep the analysis tractibe such that useful results can be found and used while the result is still useful."

The present technology replaces or augments conventional robot programming and control by enabling a user to define a hardware-agnostic brain that uses Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems, machine vision systems, and neural networks to control a robot based on sensory input acquired by the robot's sensors. The interface for defining the brain allows the user to create behaviors from combinations of sensor stimuli and robot actions, or responses, and to group these behaviors to form brains. An Application Program Interface (API) underneath the interface translates the behaviors' inputs and outputs into API calls and commands specific to particular robots. This allows the user to port brains among different types of robot to robot without knowing specifics of the robot commands."

A synapse map provides a mapping of the received identifier to a synapse configuration in the memory. A synapse configuration circuit associates the identifier with a set of synaptic connections, possibly shared hierarchically over populations of neurons defined implicitly by the mapping structures, that are read from the memory. The synaptic connections determine n-tuple information comprising a dendriteID, a weight, and a network delay time. A dendrite accumulator circuit accumulates weight values scheduled at the appropriate future time as identified by the n-tuple information and maps them to a soma compartment. A soma circuit maintains soma compartment state in response to the accumulated weight values scheduled for servicing and, wh..."
