Various implementations provide methodologies for automatically formulating machine learning (“ML”) and optimization queries. The automatic generation of ML and/or optimization queries can be configured to use examples to facilitate formulation of ML and optimization queries. One example method includes accepting input data specifying variables and data values associated with the variables. Within the input data any unspecified data records are identified, and a relationship between the variables specified in the input data and a variable associated with the at least one unspecified data record is automatically determined. The relationship can be automatically determined based on training data contained within the input data. Once a relationship is established a ML problem can be automatically generated.",

More specifically, an owner identification system receives information about an item from a finder of the item and generates, based on the information, a found item profile including characteristics historically associated with typical owners of such an item. The system generates a set of profiles of user preferences based on social media activity of the users and determines, based on a comparison of the found item profile with the user preferences profile, a likelihood that the user is the owner of the item. Based on this determination, the finder of the item can be notified of an identification of a potential owner. Successful matches between found items and their owners can be entered into a cognitive learning system to improve future outcomes.",

The DBMS includes one or more databases, each of which is monitored by sensors that detect conditions indicative of database performance. An operational engine receives input from the sensors, translates it into a form understandable by an artificially intelligent decision engine, and forwards the translated input to the decision engine. The decision engine uses preloaded knowledge elements stored in a knowledgebase to infer whether the sensor input identifies an issue that must be resolved by a database-administration activity. If so, the decision engine attempts to select a best solution, optionally seeks confirmation of its selection from an outside source, and directs the operational engine to implement the selected solution.

In an example, a supervised process is used for strengthening connections to classifier neurons, with a supervised learning process of receiving a first spike at a classifier neuron from a processing neuron in response to training data, and receiving an out-of-band communication of a second desired (artificial) spike at the classifier neuron that corresponds to the classification of the training data. As a result of spike timing dependent plasticity, connections to the classifier neuron are strengthened. In another example, a cascaded technique is disclosed to generate a plurality of trained neural networks that are separately initialized and trained based on different types or forms of training data, which may be used with cascaded or parallel operation of the plurality of trained neural networks.",

The system generates the ACs based on component models for each component type in the network and may perform offline evaluation of the ACs using determined conditional probabilities and potential state values and cache the results. When an issue is identified at a component, the system uses a relational schema to determine a set of components on which the component depends and creates a diagnosis model for performing root cause analysis. The diagnosis model includes the component type ACs corresponding to each of the components identified in the relational schema. The system populates the diagnosis model with conditional probabilities and observed state values determined from event indications generated by the components. The system outputs a most probable explanation of the issue based on evaluation of the diagnosis model.",

Once trained, the machine learning classifier can select a mode of operation for the computing device based upon a user's current brain activity and, potentially, other biological data. The computing device can then be operated in accordance with the selected modality. An application programming interface can also expose an interface through which an operating system and application programs executing on the computing device can obtain data identifying the modality selected by the machine learning classifier. Through the use of this data, the operating system and application programs can modify their mode of operation to be most suitable for the user's current mental state.",

The decision problem includes information about a plurality of outcome vectors that represent all possible outcomes and the uncertainties associated with the decision problem. The system determines whether the received decision model can be solved without receiving any preference information from the decision maker. The system receives partially specified preference information from the decision maker if the received decision model cannot be solved without any preference information. The system solves the decision model with the partially specified preference information. The system recommends, based on the solution, one or more decisions to the decision maker.",

For a given time horizon, a time series data splitter splits the time into training data corresponding to a training time period, and a validation time period corresponding to a validation time period between the training time period and the given horizon. A model tuner tunes the prediction model of the given horizon fitting an initial prediction model to the parameter using the training data thereby using machine learning. The model tuner also tunes the initial prediction model by adjusting an effect of the external data on the prediction to generate a final prediction model for the given horizon using the validation data.

The processing device determines whether the first object is represented by a relational model or an object-oriented model. The first object is determined to be represented by the relational model responsive to the first object lacking a reference to a nested object. The first object is determined to be represented by the object-oriented model responsive to the first object including a reference to a nested object. If the first object is represented by the relational model, a join is performed between the first object and a second object based on a relationship between the objects using a first node.

The system improves the trendability of the output features, which may better represent the degradation pattern of such systems. The disclosed system has been demonstrated to improve trendability and RUL prediction accuracy, offering improved predictive power earlier in the life cycle of the machine, tool, or part. During operation, the system implements an RBM including a loss function. The system then extracts a set of features from a degradation measurement via the RBM. The system fits a rate-of-change slope for a respective feature and adds a regularization term to the loss function based on the fitted slope. The system then selects a subset of the enhanced features based on a measure of mon...",

The interval window is partitioned into frames and, at each frame, embodiments calculate a cost of assigning a role to each agent based on one or more exemplar formations. A formation is determined by assigning a role to each agent based on the calculated cost. Each frame of the formation is compared to a corresponding frame of a stored formation, by calculating a distance between a position of each assigned role in the frame and a position of a corresponding role in the stored formation and by comparing the object trajectory for the one or more objects with a corresponding object trajectory in the stored formation.

The imperfect annotations designate a plurality of instances as belonging to the target rare class and others to the majority class. First, a classifier is trained on the set of features using the imperfect annotation as supervision, to designate each instance to either the rare class or majority class. A combination of the predictions from the trained classifier and the imperfect annotations is then used to classify each instance to either the rare class or majority class. In particular, an instance is classified to the rare class only when both the trained classifier and the imperfect annotation classify the instance to the rare class.

In an example, the learning operations include processing a spike train input at a neuron of a spiking neural network, applying a synaptic weight, and observing spike events occurring before and after the neuron processing based on respective spike traces. A synaptic weight update process operates to generate a new value of the synaptic weight based upon the spike traces, configuration values, and a reference weight value. A reference weight update process also operates to generate a new value of the reference value for significant changes to the synaptic weight. Reinforcement may be provided in some examples to implement changes to the reference weight in reduced time. In some examples, the techniques may be implemented in a neuromorphic hardware implementation of the spiking neural network.",

We define a classifier (e.g., K-nearest neighbor, decision tree, margin-based classifier or other) using the training subset and at least one of the features (or subsets of two or more features in combination). We apply the classifier to a subset of samples. A filter is applied to the performance of the classifier on the sample subset and the at least one feature is added to a “filtered feature list” if the classifier performance passes the filter. We do this for many different realizations of the separation of the development sample set into two subsets, and, for each realization, different features or sets of features in combination.

A cognitive or an input agent provides an input of an active concept which is matched against existing domain concepts. The resultant pool of relevant domain concepts is then used to derive virtual concept definitions using a semantic processing protocol. The derivation is then overlaid with a concept of relative proximity of an attribute from another within an attribute set. An additional layer of coherence is given by the relative proximity measure. The end result is a pool of related virtual concept definitions in a tree structure.",

A first slice of a prostate tissue sample is stained so that luminal epithelial cells and basal epithelial cells are stained different colors. A first digital image is taken of the first slice. The second slice of the sample is stained so that M1 type macrophages and M2 type macrophages are differentially stained. A second digital image is taken of the second slice. The system analyzes the first digital image and defines regions of non-intact glands. Intact gland regions are then determined, and regions of stroma are identified. The system defines influence zones between non-intact regions and stroma regions. Using information from the second image, macrophages in the tissue corresponding to the influence zones are identified and counted. Based at least in part on this count, the system determines a score. The score is indicative of whether the patient will experience PSA recurrence.",

A decision-making process may be executed to make a decision regarding operations of the organization, and the AI engine may be employed to analyze the various aspects of a decision and determine a risk level associated with the decision. The risk level may be a combination of the probability of a negative outcome and a magnitude of loss that may occur due to a negative outcome. The automated process may also determine a confidence level that indicates a degree of confidence in the determined risk level. Risk and confidence may be independent values. Implementations may enable risk mitigation by providing a risk estimate with higher confidence than traditional methods.",

The invention is used to identify a specific decision tree or group of preferred size trees that are consistent across train and test samples in node-specific details that are often important to decision makers. Specifically, for a tree to be identified as preferred by this system, the train and test samples must both agree on key measures for every terminal node of the tree. In addition to this node-by-node criterion, an additional tree selection method may be imposed. Accordingly, the train and test samples rank order the nodes on a relevant measure in the same way. Both consistency criteria may be applied in a fuzzy manner in which agreement must be close but need not be exact.",

In response to receiving the request, user information associated with the user is determined. Predicted responses of the user to each variation of a plurality of variations of the web content are determined using prediction models and the user information. The prediction models include one or more decision trees generated using a splitting criterion requiring a minimum number of positive responses to a variation and a minimum number of negative responses to the variation as a condition of considering the possible split. The variation determined to have a threshold likelihood of yielding a predicted positive response of the predicted responses is selected based on the user information.

Since the sentence groups are formed by consecutive sentences, it may be guaranteed that the sentence groups themselves have good coherence in logic, so that the final sentence groups obtained through expanding the initial sentence groups have good coherence in logic correspondingly. Thus, this invention may override the drawback of lacking logical coherence in extracted knowledge information in the prior art.",

The computing system can also determine a risk associated with multiple chains of tasks and aggregate the risks associated with the multiple chains of tasks. Determining the risk associated with each chain of tasks in the multiple chains of tasks can normalize a risk represented by the chains of tasks. Determining the risk associated with each chain of tasks or normalizing the risks represented by the chains can improve communication by the various computing systems in the network.",

A model can be trained to make these predictions using a combination of individual predictions compared to base truth and sequences of predictions based on previous predictions, where the resulting sequence is compared to the base truth sequence. In particular, the model can initially use the individual predictions to train the model. The model can then be further trained over the training data in multiple iterations, where each iteration includes two processes for each training element. In the first process, an initial part of the sequence is predicted, and the model and model parameters are updated after each prediction. In the second process, the entire remaining amount of the sequence is predicted and compared to the corresponding training sequence to adjust model parameters to encourage or discourage each prediction.",

Aspects of the disclosure demonstrate that off-chip memory in such CNN systems is underutilized due to at least three characteristics namely, data layout, data locality and inter-kernel redundancy. Aspects of the disclosure examine the performance impact of different data layouts and then describe a method to produce data layout selection for various layers of the CNN including a fast transformation implementation. Disclosed are improvements to data locality from working set expansion, elimination of inter-kernel redundancy and increase of TLP using kernel reconstruction techniques including kernel fusion and thread injection. Disclosed experimental results show that our optimizations are very effective to boost the performance of CNNs by amounts up to 9.76 times for a single kernel and 2.05 times for a netwo...",

Exercising the classifiers and schematizers on hundreds of millions of items may expose value that is inherent to the data by adding usable meta-data.

Various embodiments of the invention provide for high-throughput batching that increases throughput of streaming data in high-traffic applications, such as real-time speech transcription. In embodiments, throughput is increased by dynamically assembling into batches and processing together user requests that randomly arrive at unknown timing such that not all the data is present at once at the time of batching. Some embodiments allow for performing steaming classification using pre-processing. The gains in performance allow for more efficient use of a compute engine and drastically reduce the cost of deploying large neural networks at scale, while meeting strict application requirements and adding relatively little computational latency so as to maintain a satisfactory application experience.",

The partitionings and regions are organized via a binary tree and they are allowed to vary in a data-driven way, i.e., in a way to minimize the classification error rate. Moreover, to test a given data point, a mixture of decisions is obtained through the models learned in the regions that this point falls in. Hence, naturally, in the cold start phase of the data stream, the simpler models belonging to the larger regions are favored and as more data get available, the invention automatically puts more weights on the more complex models.",

The noncanonical communication can be preprocessed by (I) generating a vector including multiple characters from a term of the multiple terms; and (II) repeating a substring of the term in the vector such that a last character of the substring is positioned in a last position in the vector. The vector can be transmitted to a neural network configured to receive the vector and generate multiple probabilities based on the vector. A normalized version of the noncanonical communication can be determined using one or more of the multiple probabilities generated by the neural network. Whether the normalized version of the noncanonical communication should be outputted can also be determined using at least one of the multiple probabilities generated by the neural network.",

Features of historical inputs from a user as well as corresponding outputs presented to the user in response to the historical inputs are obtained, where the features are previously determined based on contexts of the historical inputs which indicate information related to the user. The features of the historical inputs are assigned into a plurality of groups. An association is determined on the basis of the plurality of groups of features. Specifically, an association indicating inter-group correlations of features from different ones of the groups is determined according to the obtained outputs. Therefore, in determining the association, intra-group correlations such as correlations of features within a group are excluded. In this way, the time and computation complexity for the association determination will be effectively reduced.",

The method includes the steps of (1) specimen gross examination, submission and dictation, (2) final diagnosis dictation, and (3) Cancer Protocol Templates construction. SMILE “listens” to the voice commands, “reads” case/slide information, goes through algorithms, and engages in report preparation. SMILE performs secretarial tasks, such as typing, error checking, important information announcing, and inputting commands by simulating keystrokes and mouse clicks, thus enabling the user to focus on the professional tasks at hand. This results in an increase in the efficiency for the user, and a decrease in reporting errors. Human-SMILE interaction is very much human-to-human like, mediated by voice recognition technology and text-to-speech. There is a significant reduction in the keyboard and mouse usage in comparison to e...",

The historical scenarios provide data on racing settings, racing results, and racing conditions such as squad information, equipment information, and environmental information. A cognitive (deep question answering) system can select an initial pattern template based on current racing conditions, and present suggested vehicle settings to the user (driver) using the initial pattern template. The driver can select from different candidate values for various factors, which may lead to the presentation of additional suggestions or the use of additional pattern templates.

Given precomputed tracking controllers, a simulation application segments the controllers into control fragments and learns a scheduler that selects control fragments at runtime to accomplish a task. In one embodiment, each scheduler may be modeled with a Q-network that maps a high-level representation of the state of the simulation to a control fragment for execution. In such a case, the deep Q-learning algorithm applied to learn the Q-network schedulers may be adapted to use a reward function that prefers the original controller sequence and an exploration strategy that gives more chance to in-sequence control fragments than to out-of-sequence control fragments. Such a modified Q-learning algorithm learns schedulers that are capable of following the original controller sequence most of the time while selecting out-of-sequence contr...",

The set of QA pairs is then processed with the corpus of input text to extract a set of input keywords and concepts. A concept dependency graph is then used to perform disambiguation operations on the set of input keywords and concepts, and the reference keywords and concepts it contains, to generate a set of distractor words. The resulting set of distractor words is then processed with the set of QA pairs to generate a set of multiple choice question-answers that include various distractor answers.",

A performance-analysis system receives feedback from which may be inferred an audience's reaction to the performance. This feedback may be derived from sensors embedded in instruments or microphones, from video-input devices that visually represent the audience's body language and facial expressions, and from performance ratings and natural-language comments submitted by audience members to a social-media network or performance-rating application. An analytics engine of the performance-analysis system uses methods of artificial intelligence to infer the audience's emotional state from the received feedback and to determine whether certain characteristics of the performance are undesirable. The system represents these inferences as a value of a performance index and represents the index value to the performers. The system may also make specific recommendations deemed likely to reduce undesir...",

A computerized oracle-selection system identifies candidate “oracle” experts in a field of endeavor known as a domain. The system retrieves contemporaneous natural-language “artifact” documents that each refer to or were produced by an oracle, and contains information from which may be predicted a future event related to the domain. The system assigns each oracle a confidence factor that identifies the accuracy of that oracle's predictions, and ranks the artifacts by how closely each matches the domain and by the confidence factors of its associated oracles. The artifacts are merged into the corpus, where the rankings indicate which artifacts may most reliably be used by the cognitive system to formulate predictive responses to user queries. This procedure is repeated each time the system receives user feedback or an updated set of artifacts.",

The method and apparatus receive the inquiry from a client via a network. Based on the inquiry, question-answer pairs retrieved from the network are analyzed to determine a response to the inquiry. The QA pairs are not predefined. As a result, the QA pairs have to be analyzed in order to determine whether they are responsive to a particular inquiry. Questions of the QA pairs may be repetitive and similar to one another even for very different subjects, and without additional contextual and meta-level information, are not useful in determining whether their corresponding answer responds to an inquiry.",

Example systems implement machine learning based on neural networks that draw low power for use in smart phones, watches, drones, automobiles, and medical devices. The onboard machine learning assemblies can be powered by batteries, and once onboard a small personal device, can learn to perform object recognition and autonomous decision-making without access to outside resources. The assemblies can be small or even nano-scale, and may draw less than one watt of power on average. An assembly can be configured from pluggable, interchangeable modules that have compatible ports for interconnecting and integrating functionally dissimilar sensor systems. A core module contains a machine learning kernel, and multiple cores can be connected together to expand the neural network.

Also, the subnetworks convolve 3D data at multiple scales by subjecting the 3D data to parallel processing by different 3D convolutional layer paths. Such multi-scale operations are computationally cheaper than the traditional CNNs that perform serial convolutions. In addition, performance of the subnetworks is further improved through 3D batch normalization (BN) that normalizes the 3D input fed to the subnetworks, which in turn increases learning rates of the 3D DCNNA. After several layers of 3D convolution and 3D sub-sampling with 3D across a series of subnetwork modules, a feature map with reduced vertical dimensionality is generated from the 3D radiological volume and fed into one or more f...",

A “Business Operation” is defined as a sequence of particular order in which related structured activities that serve a particular business goal follow each other, and structured activities are processes and events. The control system operates in real time and automatic generation of feedback for identifying next activity to be conducted is enabled by an innovative data driven automatic generation of feedback technique. This closed loop feedback control system continues conducting activities of all occurrences of business operations automatically until a feedback identifies a terminator activity of a particular occurrence marking completion of conducting that occurrence.",

A first neuron is activated to cause a spike wave to propagate from the first neuron to other neurons in the SNN. Propagation of the spike wave causes synaptic weights of a subset of the synapses to be increased based on the STDP rule. A second neuron is activated after propagation of the spike wave to cause a spike chain to propagate along a path from the second neuron to the first neuron, based on the changes to the synaptic weights. A physical path is determined from the second to the first neuron based on the spike chain, and a signal may be sent to a controller of an autonomous device to cause the autonomous to navigate the physical path.",

Temporal synapse circuits, with associated weight values, can be used to control spike times of connected neuron circuits. The controlled spike times of multiple neuron circuits can be used to temporally encode information in a neural network in neuromorphic hardware. Neuron circuits in a state space detection layer can be organized into multiple subsets. Neuron circuits in different subsets can be connected to output neuron circuits in an output layer by separate temporal synapse circuits. Spiking signals sent from the neuron circuits in the state space detection layer via separate temporal synapse circuits can cause associated output neuron circuits to generate output spiking signals at different times. The various spike times of the output neuron circuits can be aggregated to produce an output signal for the network.",

First indicators (KQIs) are categorized into first groups (states) and second indicators (KPIs) are categorized into second groups. A conditional probability is estimated by calculating a probability that the second indicators will result in degradation of the first indicators based on historical data using association rule learning. The second indicators having the conditional probability associated with degradation of the first indicators are mapped to a corresponding one of the first groups in a probabilistic network structure based on a detected degradation of the first indicators in the historical data. Then it is determined whether the second indicators mapped to the corresponding first groups satisfy a threshold when degradation of the first indicators is detected, and each of the second indicators resulting in degradation of the first indicator are ranked according to a corresp...",

Using training data, a GMCM estimate can be produced and iteratively refined to maximize a penalized log likelihood estimate until sequential iterations are within a threshold value of one another. The GMCM estimate can then be used to classify further samples.

The present technology replaces or augments conventional robot programming and control by enabling a user to define a hardware-agnostic brain that uses Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems, machine vision systems, and neural networks to control a robot based on sensory input acquired by the robot's sensors. The interface for defining the brain allows the user to create behaviors from combinations of sensor stimuli and robot actions, or responses, and to group these behaviors to form brains. An Application Program Interface (API) underneath the interface translates the behaviors' inputs and outputs into API calls and commands specific to particular robots. This allows the user to port brains among different types of robot to robot without knowing specifics of the robot commands.",

The mixture signal includes a plurality of separate signals from different signal sources. The mixture signal is digitized by the ADC. A first digitized signal and a second digitized signal are generated that are the same. The first digitized signal is delayed a predetermined time delay and the second digitized signal is processed in a neuromorphic signal processor to extract an extracted signal. The predetermined time delay corresponds to a delay embedding in the neuromorphic signal processor.

For each resulted subset, the data is split randomly into training data sets and testing data sets. A feed-forward back propagation neural network is built for each subset in the third step. The simulation model is calibrated utilizing actual production history from the training data set. The model performance is tested utilizing actual production history from the testing data set.

More specifically, the present technology relates to using bootstrap sampling to determine whether a termination rule for an validation is terminating the validation at an appropriate time. Conditions or criteria for termination may include a variety of different parameters, rules or thresholds, such as a termination or cut threshold. The bootstrap termination rule can be one or several values associated with the participant's validation and that can be used to determine when to terminate a validation apart from determining that the participant has passed the validation.",

In current recommendation systems, users only play a passive role and have limited control over the recommendation generation process. As a result, there is often considerable mismatch between the recommendations made by these systems and the actual user interests, which are fine-grained and constantly evolving. With a user-powered distributed recommendation architecture, individual users can flexibly define fine-grained communities of interest in a declarative fashion and obtain recommendations accurately tailored to their interests by aggregating opinions of users in such communities. By combining a progressive sampling technique with data perturbation methods, the recommendation system is both scalable and privacy-preserving.",

The circuit comprises a plurality of neural modules. Each neural module comprises multiple digital neurons such that each neuron in a neural module has a corresponding neuron in another neural module. An interconnection network comprising a plurality of digital synapses interconnects the neural modules. Each synapse interconnects a first neural module to a second neural module by interconnecting a neuron in the first neural module to a corresponding neuron in the second neural module. Corresponding neurons in the first neural module and the second neural module communicate via the synapses. Each synapse comprises a learning rule associating a neuron in the first neural module with a corresponding neuron in the second neural module. A control module generates signals which define a set of time steps for event-driven operation of the neurons and event communication via the interconnection network.",

Such neural networks provide new ways of performing computation in human-engineered computing systems that employ the same basic paradigm as the mammalian neocortex. Information is encoded based on the relative timing of individual voltage spikes produced, consumed, and computed upon by groups of neurons. Component and interconnection delays are an integral part of the computation process. Multi-connection paths between pairs of neurons are modeled as a single compound path. Multi-layer networks are trained from the input layer proceeding one layer at a time to the output layer. Training involves a computation that is local to each synapse, and synaptic weights are determined by an averaging method.

Real-world data collected from transportation networks can be used to incorporate the data's intrinsic behavior into a time-series mining technique to enhance its accuracy for traffic prediction. For example, the spatiotemporal behaviors of rush hours and events can be used to perform a more accurate prediction of both short-term and long-term average speed on road-segments, even in the presence of infrequent events (e.g., accidents). Taking historical rush-hour behavior into account can improve the accuracy of traditional predictors by up to 67% and 78% in short-term and long-term predictions, respectively. Moreover, the impact of an accident can be incorporated to improve the prediction accuracy by up to 91%.",

The model includes detection, feature production and classification steps. It employs Bayesian Probabilistic Models (BPMs) to characterize complex real-world behaviors under uncertainty. The BPM learning is incremental. Online learning enables BPM adaptation to new data. The available data drives BPM complexity (e.g., number of states) accommodating spatial and temporal ambiguities, occlusions, environmental clutter, and large inter-domain data variability. Generic Sequential Bayesian Inference (GSBI) efficiently operates over BPMs to process streaming or forensic data. Deep Belief Networks (DBNs) learn feature representations from data. Examples include model applications for streaming imagery (e.g., video) and automatic target recognition (ATR).",

The cyclotomic integer approximation is randomly modified until a modified value can be expanded into a single-qubit unitary matrix by solving one or more norm equations. The matrix is then expanded into a two-qubit unitary matrix of special form, which is then decomposed into an optimal two-qubit Clifford+T circuit. A two-qubit RUS circuit using a primary qubit and an ancillary qubit is then obtained based on the latter decomposition. An alternate embodiment is disclosed that keeps the total T-depth of the derived circuit small using at most 3 additional ancilla qubits. Arbitrary unitary matrices defined over the cyclotomic field of 8th roots of unity are implemented with RUS circuits.",

The discontinuities represent interfaces such that different phases in two adjacent regions result in a metal-semiconductor interface. The interface supports a charge accumulation and a discharge of accumulated charge when an activation energy provided, for example, by electrical current, localized heating or optical energy, reaches a threshold necessary for breakdown of a potential barrier presented by the interface, and thus mimics a leaky integrate-and-fire neuron. With many such interfaces distributed through the structure, the local inputs to a neuron become a weighted sum of energy from neighboring neurons. Thus, different combinations of signals at one or more inputs connected to the structure will favor different neural pathways through the structure, thereby resulting in a neural network.",

The predicted outcomes can be used by owners and operators of oil rigs, mines, factories, and other operational sites to identify potential failures and take preventive and/or remedial action with respect to industrial assets. In one implementation, historical data associated with a plurality of outcomes is received at one or more central site servers from one or more data sources, and datasets are generated from the historical data. Using the datasets, a set of models is trained to predict an outcome. A particular model includes sub-models corresponding to a hierarchy of components of an industrial asset. The set of models is combined into an ensemble model, which is transmitted to remote sites.",

Elements in a dataset related to an email campaign are modeled using a tree structure, where nodes of the tree represent features of each element. A mean squared error is computed of an outcome for each of the elements to determine a weight for each respective tree. The weights are then regularized by applying a penalty, such as an elastic net penalty, to each of the weights. Then, the weights are applied to each of the trees. A weighted average of all of the outcomes of the trees is calculated, where the weighted average represents a prediction of an outcome resulting from a set of feature values. The feature values correspond to the nodes of each of the trees.",

Indicators and models are selected that identify network characteristics and trends of interest. The indicators can be derived by applying a combination of citation analyses, natural language processing, entity disambiguation, organization classification, and time series analyses. A metric can be used to evaluate indicator utility. A framework can be sued to generate and validate the indicators. The models can be derived using an automated process.

A shared model for a cluster is common to the categories assigned to the cluster. In this manner, the shared models are specific to the group of categories (e.g., selected content providers) in each cluster while requiring a reasonable computational complexity for the online system. The categories are clustered based on the performance of a model specific to a category on data for other categories.",

The system utilizes neighborhood sampling and combinatorial relations to estimate graphlet counts, statistics, and frequency distributions in a small fraction of the computing time of existing systems. The obtained unbiased estimates are highly accurate, and have applications in the analysis, mining, and predictive modeling of massive real-world networks. During operation, the system obtains data indicating vertices and edges of a graph. The system samples a portion of the graph and counts a number of graph features in the sampled portion of the graph. The system then computes an occurrence frequency of a graphlet pattern and a total number of graphlets associated with the graphlet pattern in the graph.",

Various of the disclosed embodiments allow information captured from a depth camera on an HCl system to be used to recognize such gestures. Particularly, the HCl system's depth sensor may capture depth frames of the user's movements over time. To discern gestures from these movements, the system may group portions of the user's anatomy represented by the depth data into classes. “Features” which reflect distinguishing features of the user's anatomy may be used to accomplish this classification. Some embodiments provide improved systems and methods for generating and/or selecting these features. Features prepared by various of the disclosed embodiments may be less susceptible to overfitting training data and may more quickly distinguish portions of the user's anatomy.",

The one or more computer processors compare the detected electromagnetic noise signal of the object to one or more stored electromagnetic noise signals associated with one or more objects. Based, at least in part, on the comparison, the one or more computer processors determine the identity of the object. Responsive to determining the identity of the object, the one or more computer processors store metadata associated with at least one of the objects and an electromagnetic noise signal detection event. The one or more computer processors determine whether an amount of the metadata associated with the object meets a learning threshold. If the amount of metadata meets the learning threshold, the one or more computer processors predict a subsequent electromagnetic noise signal detection event associated with the object.",

Mirror DNNs regularize to a linear function and train very quickly. Mirror DNNs employ a neural network pattern recognizer that receives a set of features extracted from an input signal and inputs the set of features into a multi-layer neural network. The multi-layer neural network has an input layer that receives the set of features, a plurality of intermediate layers, and an output layer that generates a set of output values that are indicative of a recognized pattern exhibited in the input signal. A first and second non-linear equation pair are chosen and applied to intermediate layers of the neural network so as to make the output values that are indicative of a pattern exhibited in the input signal linear.",

An example process for jointly training multiple machine learning models includes providing a set of machine learning models that are to learn a respective task, the set of machine learning models including a first machine learning model and a second machine learning model. The process can initiate training of the first machine learning model to learn a task using training data. During the training of the first machine learning model, information can be passed between the first machine learning model and the second machine learning model. Such passing of information (or “transfer of knowledge”) between the machine learning models can be accomplished via the formulation, and optimization, of an objective function that comprises model parameters that are based on the multiple machine learning models in the set.",

The question and answer customer support system determines which customer support content to provide to users by using the hybrid predictive model, according to one embodiment. The question and answer customer support system receives a search query from a user and applies the search query (or a representation of the search query) to the hybrid predictive model, according to one embodiment. The hybrid predictive model generates a likelihood that particular customer support content is relevant to a user's search query, according to one embodiment. The question and answer customer support system acquires user feedback from users and updates/trains the hybrid predictive model based on the user feedback, according to one embodiment.",

The predictive system makes predictions by learning spatial patterns and temporal sequences in an input data that change over time. As the input data is received, the predictive system generates a series of predictions based on the input data. Each prediction is compared with corresponding actual value or state. If the prediction does not match or deviates significantly from the actual value or state, an anomaly is identified for further analysis. A corresponding state or a series of states of the predictive system before or at the time of prediction are associated with the anomaly and stored.

An eigCG solver is applied to determine a descent direction by minimizing a local approximated quadratic model of the loss function with respect to current parameter values and the training dataset. An approximate leftmost eigenvector and eigenvalue is determined while solving the Newton system. The approximate leftmost eigenvector is used as negative curvature direction to prevent the optimization method from converging to saddle points. Curvilinear and adaptive line-searches are used to guide the optimization method to a local minimum. At the end of the iteration, the current parameter values are updated based on the desce...",

For an iterative method, a quantum computing system may be designed, operated, and/or adapted to provide a rate of convergence that is greater than the rate of convergence of a digital supercomputer. When the digital supercomputer is iteratively used to evaluate an objective function at a cost incurred of C per iteration, the quantum computing system may be used to provide the input parameter(s) to the objective function and quickly converge on the input parameter(s) that optimize the objective function. Thus, a quantum computing system may be used to minimize the total cost incurred CT for consumption of digital supercomputer resources when a digital supercomputer is iteratively employed to evaluate an objective function.",

A postsynaptic capacitor builds up a leaky integrate and fire (LIF) charge. An axon LIF pulse generator activates a LIF discharge path from the postsynaptic capacitor through the resistive memory element when the axon LIF pulse generator generates axon LIF pulses. A postsynaptic comparator compares the capacitor voltage to a threshold voltage and generates postsynaptic output pulses when the capacitor voltage passes the threshold voltage. The postsynaptic output pulses include a postsynaptic firing characteristic dependent on a frequency of the axon LIF pulses. A refractory circuit prevents the postsynaptic comparator from generating additional postsynaptic output pulses until a refractory time passes since a preceding postsynaptic output pulse. A training circuit adjusts the postsynaptic firing characteristic to match a target firing characteristic.",

An execution report shows in the user-selected order for each of the rules, whether the rule was executed, the inputs matched to partial conditions of the rule, and partial condition evaluation results. User rule management experience is also enhanced in other ways. For example, a graphical user interface permits user selection of a schema xpath, bulk selection of XML schema nodes to define vocabulary used in rules, if-then-else rules, rules with embedded SQL, marking rules as active or not, receiving multiple kinds of input from a single text input box, locally executing rules, importing rules authored elsewhere, iterating over a collection of objects, and validating rules against vocabulary data types.",

A test pattern duration d is estimated for a set of test patterns P, and each test pattern is presented to the spiking reservoir for a duration of d/P seconds. Output spikes from the spiking reservoir are generated via readout neurons. The output spikes are measured and the measurements are used to compute firing rate codes, each firing rate code corresponding to a test pattern in the set of test patterns P.

By performing a guided hierarchical classification algorithm with a decision tree structure and grouping the minority class(es) in with some of the majority classes, large majority classes may be separated from a minority class without requiring good detection of the minority events by themselves. The decision tree structure may be used only for the purpose of identifying if the data sample in question is a member of a minority class. If it is determined that it is not, a primary classification algorithm may be used. With this approach, the guided hierarchical classification algorithm need not perform as well as the primary classification algorithm for the majority events, but may provide improved detection for minority events.",

Relevance may be dramatically improved by automatically classifying queries and web pages in useful categories, and using these classification scores as relevance features. A thorough approach may require building a large number of classifiers, corresponding to the various types of information, activities, and products. Creation of classifiers and schematizers is provided on large data sets. Exercising the classifiers and schematizers on hundreds of millions of items may expose value that is inherent to the data by adding usable meta-data. Some aspects include active labeling exploration, automatic regularization and cold start, scaling with the number of items and the number of classifiers, active featuring, and segmentation and schematization.",

After obtaining base sensatory data tied to the online profile of the recipient, the system may filter the base sensatory data by searching the base sensatory data for one or more machine-cognizable characteristics. The filtered sensatory data may be provided to an execution group, which may review displays of the sensatory data. Responsive to the displays of the sensatory data, the execution group may generate descriptors of the content of the filtered sensatory data and send the descriptors to the system. The system may process the descriptors to generate or augment the decision-predictive recipient profile.",

The conductance value associated with an edge is a function of at least the toxicity values of the nodes to which the edge is incident. A signal flow analysis is conducted with respect to an input node representing an observable associated with an offense. The flow analysis seeks to identify a subset of the nodes that, based on their conductance values, are reached by flow of a signal representing a threat, wherein signal flow over a path in the graph continues until a signal threshold is met.

The loss calculation unit calculates a loss with respect to the task on the basis of the approximated feature value. The approximation control unit controls an approximation precision of the approximation function with respect to the step function such that the approximation function used with the approximation unit approaches the step function according to a decrease in the loss.

These problem cause difficult detection of various wastewater treatment parameter such as biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) values that are used to monitor water quality. To solve problems associated with monitoring BOD values in real-time, the present disclosure utilizes a self-organizing recurrent RBF neural network designed for intelligent detecting of BOD values. Implementations of the present disclosure build a computing model of BOD values based on the self-organizing recurrent RBF neural network to achieve real-time and more accurate detection of the BOD values (e.g., a BOD concentration). The implementations herein quickly and accurately obtain BOD concentrations and improve the quality and efficiency of wastewater treatment.",

A processing device collects digital interview data including features identified from candidate interviews. A model training tool selects a data set of the digital interview data. The data set includes a predicted performance outcome and an actual performance outcome for each of a plurality of candidates. The model training tool determines an error metric for each of the plurality of candidates. The error metric includes a relationship between the predicted performance outcome and the actual performance outcome for each candidate. The model training tool determines a number of candidates whose digital interview data includes a feature corresponding to a protected class. The model training tool normalizes an effect of each candidate on the error metric based on the corresponding protected class and applies the normalized error metric to reduce bias in the predictive model with respect to the protected class.",

A first generation of context-dependent conditions upon the business rule is identified by analyzing the information source and other, related, sources, and the business rule is modified to account for this first generation of context-dependent conditions. Context-dependent conditions that place constraints upon the previously identified first-generation conditions are then identified and the business rule is further modified to account for this next generation of context-dependent conditions. This process repeats iteratively through multiple generations of identifications, until the business rule has been modified to accommodate all contextual information that may be gleaned from all analyzed information sources.

Both variants involve treating the ensemble model as a black box, identifying trivial values for input variables to the ensemble model, replacing each of the input variables to the ensemble model with its corresponding trivial values and then evaluating the impact on a score of the model after the trivial value replacement. The evaluation result of the impact is then used to generate the reason codes for the ensemble model. Specifically, the first variant is configured to perform one round of replacement, wherein variables with top drops in the score will be the reason codes. The second variant is configured to perform multiple rounds of replacement, which in each round, keeps the identified reason codes variables replaced with trivial values and analyzes incremental drops of replacing remaining variables.",

The training involves partitioning the training data for training the classifier into multiple data blocks. The partitions may preserve the joint distribution of input features and an output class of the training data. The training may further include performing an ADMM iteration on the multiple data blocks in an initial order using multiple worker nodes. Subsequently, the training of the classifier is determined to be completed if a stop criterion is satisfied following the ADMM iteration. Otherwise, if the stop criterion is determined to be unsatisfied following the ADMM iteration, one or more additional ADMM iterations may be performed on different orders of the multiple data blocks until the stop criterion is satisfied.",

The processor identifies sequences of interest in the time series data having predictive value. The processor compares the real-time data stream to a set of known historical patterns that act as effective leading indicators of different alarms and events. The processor extracts any identified sequences of interest from the time series data as an extracted event. The processor quantifies the relationship between the data of the extracted event and the known historical pattern by calculating a confidence level to denote a probability of occurrence of the event by comparing how closely the new time series data matches the data patterns associated with known events.",

In the embedding space, both images and text labels are represented. The text labels describe semantic concepts that are exhibited in image content. In the embedding space, the semantic concepts described by the text labels are modeled as distributions. By using distributions, each semantic concept is modeled as a continuous cluster which can overlap other clusters that model other semantic concepts. For example, a distribution for the semantic concept “apple” can overlap distributions for the semantic concepts “fruit” and “tree” since can refer to both a fruit and a tree. In contrast to using distributions, conventionally configured visual-semantic embedding spaces represent a semantic concept as a single point. Thus, unlike these conventionally configured embedding spaces, the embedding spaces described herein are generated to model semantic concepts as distributions, such as Gaussian distributions, Gauss...",

Analyzing the training documents results in a plurality of document part feature vectors, each of which correlates a category defining a document part (for example, “title” or “body paragraph”) with one or more feature-value pairs (for example, “font=Arial” or “alignment=centered”). Any suitable machine learning algorithm can be used to train the predictive model based on the document part feature vectors extracted from the training documents. Once the predictive model has been trained, it can receive feature-value pairs corresponding to a portion of an untagged document and make predictions with respect to the how that document part should be categorized. The predictive model can therefore generate tag metadata that defines a structure of the untagged document in an automated fashion.",

In various examples directed acyclic graphs are grown during training using a training objective which takes into account both connection patterns between nodes and split function parameter values. For example, a layer of child nodes is grown and connected to a parent layer of nodes using an initialization strategy. In examples, various local search processes are used to find good combinations of connection patterns and split function parameters.",

Total scores for each semantic data type are calculated from the combined features, and used as a basis for ranking the semantic data types. The total scores may reflect a weighting of the various features. In a second step, top-ranked semantic data types may be further differentiated from one another by applying additional features.

Initially a training set of user interactions can be correlated to a churn probability value for various sequences of user activity. Then, as regards a real time user, user actions in navigating through the app may be recorded, and this information can be used, in addition to user characteristics, to predict the probability that this user will churn, thus implementing in a “nip churn in the bud” approach (or, the inverse, remain loyal and continue to use the app). In some embodiments, a partial set of user actions can be identified as subsequences of known churn sequences.

The first set of global parameters includes data that weights one or more operands used in an algorithm that models an entity type. Multiple learner processors in the machine execute the algorithm using the first set of global parameters and a mini-batch of data known to describe the entity type. The machine generates a consolidated set of gradients that describes a direction for the first set of global parameters in order to improve an accuracy of the algorithm in modeling the entity type when using the first set of global parameters and the mini-batch of data. The machine transmits the consolidated set of gradients to the global parameter server. The machine then receives a second set of global parameters from the global parameter server, where the second set of global parameters is a modification of the first set of global parameters based on the consolidated set of gradients.",

The commercial process can continuously provide data collection opportunities. An intervention is designed using a model to predict the dependent outcome. The actual outcome of the intervention can be determined within the window of utility for these data. One objective is to improve intervention outcomes with prediction. Purely random outcomes (no model prediction) and outcomes resulting from the intervention (model operations) are aggregated into separate files—a sequence of control model data files and a sequence of model data files of operational data. These model data files and control model data files are used to analyze model performance and to react automatically when identified conditions warrant.",

In some embodiments, a method includes retrieving, via a processor, a multidimensional data profile that includes a set of first inclination distributions, each associated with a data dimension. The processor matches a first set of engagement rules to the multidimensional data profile to define a matched set, each engagement rule of the first set of engagement rules having a corresponding confidence level and a corresponding set of second inclination distributions. The processor selects an engagement rule from the matched set that has a corresponding confidence level no less than a corresponding confidence level for each remaining engagement rule from the matched set, and sends a signal causing display of a stimulus to a user according to the selected engagement rule and not according to the remaining engagement rules.",

A convolutional neural network (CNN) receives input of the digital image items of the different data batches, and classifier layers of the CNN are trained to recognize the common features in the digital image items of the different data batches. The recognized common features are input to fully-connected layers of the CNN that distinguish between the recognized common features of the digital image items of the different data batches. A scoring difference is determined between item pairs of the digital image items in a particular one of the different data batches. A piecewise ranking loss algorithm maintains the scoring difference between the item pairs, and the scoring difference is used to train CNN regression functions.",

For example, a repetitive characteristic of the time series can be determined by analyzing the time series for a pattern that repeats over a predetermined time period. An adjusted time series can be generated by removing the repetitive characteristic from the time series. An effect of a moving event on the adjusted time series can be determined. The moving event can occur on different dates for two or more consecutive years. A residual time series can be generated by removing the effect of the moving event from the adjusted time series. A base forecast that is independent of the repetitive characteristic and the effect of the moving event can be generated using the residual time series.

R×S×C second memory rows hold filter blocks of B words each holding P copies of a filter weight. B is the smallest factor of N greater than W.

The framework autonomously generates and solves higher order problems to find sequences of operations necessary to transform state sequences derived from the lower-order transformation simulations recursively. The solutions yield increasingly higher-order abstractions that converge to generalization such that the unwinding of the higher order sequences back down to the original problem yields the exact sequence of steps for unsolved instances of the problem in linear time without the need for re-simulation. Cooperating agents analyze solution path determinations for problems including those concerning their own optimization. This spawns state transition rules generalizable to higher layers of abstraction resulting in new knowledge enab...",

In one aspect a method includes determining an average error of a machine learning system (“MLS”). An evaluation function that provides a result that would have been achieved using a specified value of a given parameter is defined. An expected outcome function that provides expected results for prior events based on the error of the MLS is defined. For each of multiple prior events, a target value of the given parameter is determined, e.g., using the expected outcome function. A model is generated using the MLS based on features of the prior events and the determined target values of the given parameter for the prior events. A value is assigned to the given parameter for a new event based on application of the model to features of the new event.",

As the initial optimized baseline solution is determined, some regions, such as local or global maxima, minima, and/or saddle points in the objective space may be mapped. The mapping may be performed by storing mesh chromosomes corresponding to some of the features (e.g., extrema, saddle points, etc.) in the objective space along with the location of those chromosomes within the objective space (e.g., objective values corresponding to each of the objectives). The mesh chromosome may be used in subsequent re-optimization problems, such as with reformulation. Although in a re-optimization the objectives, decision variables, and or objective/constraint models may change, the mesh chromosomes may still provide information and direction for more quickly and/or with reduced resources converge on a re-optimized solution.",

The method uses version vector based rule to generate aggregated parameters and determine when to return the parameters. The method also includes coordinating the versions of aggregated parameter sets among all the parameter servers. This allows to broadcast to enforce the version consistency; generate parameter sets in an on-demand manner to facilitate version control. Furthermore the method includes enhancing the version consistency at the learner's side and resolving the inconsistent version when mismatching versions are detected.",

In one embodiment, a method operates upon an electronic data collection organized as a network of vertices and edge connections between the vertices. The method provides the recommendations includes iteratively traversing across edges that satisfy search criteria to a new set of vertices and filtering each new set of vertices to satisfy the search criteria. At the conclusion of the traversing and filtering, a final set of vertices represents the recommended entities. In some embodiments, a control vector describes a sequence of relationships between a requester and the items to be recommended. The method can assign scores to candidate recommendations and select the recommendations having the highest scores. Advantageously, the method provides flexibility and rapid execution of recommendation queries without the need to precompute intermediate results.",

The union processor biases the HTM system so a learned temporal sequence may be more quickly recognized. The union processor includes union elements that are associated with incoming spatial patterns or with cells that represent temporal relationships between the spatial patterns. A union element of the union processor may be activated if a persistence score of the union element satisfies a predetermined criterion. The persistence score of the detector is updated based on the activation states of the spatial patterns or cells associated with the detector. After activation, the union element remains active for a period longer than a time step for performing the spatial pooling.",
